This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Getting Started

Hereâ€™s the Docker setup section formatted in Markdown for your README:

## Setup with Docker

You can run this project in a Docker container to ensure consistency across environments. Follow the steps below to set up and run the application with Docker.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Steps to Run the Project

1.  **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

2.  **Build the Docker Image**

Use Docker Compose to build the image. This will install dependencies and set up the environment.

```bash
docker-compose build
```

3.  **Run the Container**

Start the container using Docker Compose. This command will start the application and make it accessible on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The application will now be running with hot-reloading enabled in development mode.

4. **Access the Application**

Open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

5.	**Stopping the Container**

To stop the running container, press `CTRL+C` in the terminal or run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Running Tests in Docker

To run tests inside the Docker container, you can use:

```bash
docker-compose run app npm test
```
